Creating a sequence diagram for your game interactions would require a more complex diagram due to the dynamic nature of the game and multiple objects involved. However, I can provide you with a simplified sequence diagram that shows the interactions between the player, spaceship, and asteroids for a specific scenario: shooting a laser at an asteroid. This sequence diagram will illustrate the message flow for this specific action:

    Player->>Spaceship: Control spaceship
    Spaceship->>Game: Spaceship controls
    Player->>Spaceship: Shoot laser (Space Bar)
    Spaceship->>Spaceship: Rotate spaceship
    Spaceship->>Spaceship: Calculate laser direction
    Spaceship->>Game: Laser fired
    Game->>Asteroid: Laser fired
    Asteroid->>Asteroid: Check collision
    alt Asteroid hit
        Asteroid->>Game: Asteroid hit
        Game->>Asteroid: Destroy asteroid
        Asteroid->>Game: Spawn new asteroid
    else Asteroid missed
        Asteroid->>Game: Laser missed
    end
    Game->>Player: Laser hit result
In this sequence diagram:

The "Player" controls the "Spaceship" by providing input.

The "Spaceship" processes the player's input, including rotating the spaceship and calculating the laser direction.

The "Spaceship" sends a message to the "Game" to indicate that a laser has been fired.

The "Game" initiates the interaction with an "Asteroid" by sending a laser fired message.

The "Asteroid" checks if it's hit by the laser, and based on the result, there are two possible scenarios:

If the asteroid is hit, it sends a message to the "Game" to destroy itself and spawn a new asteroid.
If the asteroid is missed, it sends a message to the "Game" indicating that the laser missed.
The "Game" informs the "Player" about the result of the laser hit.

This sequence diagram demonstrates the flow of messages and interactions when the player shoots a laser at an asteroid. You can extend and modify this diagram to cover other interactions and scenarios within your game as needed
